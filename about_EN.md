EduStableCoin is a revolutionary cryptocurrency system designed to combat pervasive corruption, the intellectual decline of populations, and the challenges posed by automation with artificial intelligence (AI).  
The project encompasses two coins:  
EStableCoin: A stable currency with a limit of one transaction per day, intended for transparent payments in education, freelancing, and public services. A transaction can be reversed and is more difficult to steal, while liquidity is backed by the population’s knowledge, utilized to address needs such as food, housing-construction and roads, medicine and healthcare, and the preservation of natural ecology.  
EFlexCoin: A floating coin mined through the completion of AI tasks, internet likes, or tips, supporting creativity and entertainment. It features a low cost and fluctuating price, has no transaction limits, resembles a "dog coin," operates as a subnet providing fast and simple cash, and maintains a trading game for those interested.  
The ecosystem integrates platforms for learning (motivating individuals to develop), freelancing (rewarding labor), and tax management (ensuring transparency via blockchain).  
Users themselves construct the system, acting as validators, creating unique "banknotes" (tokens with images), and participating in network governance. The project addresses corruption through decentralization, employing AI as a tool for engagement rather than human replacement. This is a people’s cryptocurrency, accessible to all—from engineers to students.
Technologically, the project is built on a proprietary blockchain with smart contracts integrated with platforms like X for promotion and interaction. The code is open-source, and we invite everyone to join in shaping a future without centralization!
